"""``sync-issue`` — refresh ``issue_items`` from upstream sources.

**The DB is the draft; this job is its inbound mirror.** Pulls Pinboard
(Notable / Briefly) and micro.blog (Journal + Featured promotions + journal
image rehost + alt fills) into ``issue_items`` rows via
``issue_items_sync.sync_all``. Nothing is rendered and nothing is written to
S3 or disk — reading the draft is the web preview's job
(``renderers.render_body_for_issue``), and artifacts are rendered at publish
time by the publish legs.

Replaces the sync half of the retired ``update-draft`` job (the other half —
draft.md projection, daily artifact renders, the S3 draft.html preview, the
embedded Opus review — was the S3-collaboration era and is gone: see
``eddy-review`` for the on-demand review).

Triggers: daily 17:00 CT cron and the web editor's Sync button.
