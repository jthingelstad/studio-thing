"""Headless production status — phase, content presence, readiness gates.

Pure DB + S3 reads, no Discord. This is the single source of production status,
consumed by the web project page, the machine-readable feed
the lifecycle transitions
(`jobs/production_ops.py`), and — until they're retired — the phase cards.

It absorbs the state that used to live inside the card modules
(`build_card.gather_state` / `publish_card.gather_state`) and the two S3
presence primitives from `jobs/_cards.py` (`issue_files` / `read_metadata_raw`).
The card-render bits (embeds, views) stay in the card modules.
