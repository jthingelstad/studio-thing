/**
 * Source-scope helpers for the Thingy agent.
 *
 * Thingy answers over independent corpora: the Weekly Thing issue archive
 * (`weekly_thing`), Jamie's 20-year thingelstad.com blog (`blog`), and
 * Another Thing podcast transcripts (`podcast`). Scope is enforced by *which
 * corpus the retrieval scans*, not by a post-filter.
 *
 * Two-source scopes preserve the selected corpus boundary. `all` retrieves
 * candidates from every corpus and reranks the union once.
 *
 * Default is `weekly_thing` so the operator `/retrieve` path (workshop_bot) is
 * unaffected when it sends no scope.
