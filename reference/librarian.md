# Archive Librarian

Thingy is an authenticated chat interface for Jamie Thingelstad's public archive: The Weekly Thing, thingelstad.com, and Another Thing. The code name in this repo is "Librarian"; the reader-facing product is Thingy.

## Local Artifacts

- `npm run librarian:corpus` builds `data/librarian/corpus.json` from the cleaned generated archive.
- The local corpus is text-only and citation-ready. It includes issue summaries, topic metadata, and chunk-level retrieval metadata. It is gitignored and rebuilt on demand.
- Embedded corpus files should not be committed. `npm run librarian:corpus:upload` generates Bedrock Cohere embeddings and pushes the deployable corpus to S3. **Incremental by default**: it fetches the existing S3 corpus once at the start, copies cached embeddings onto unchanged chunks (matched by content-deterministic chunk_id), and only sends the leftover chunks to Bedrock. Pass `--full` to skip the cache and re-embed everything — needed only after a chunking-schema change or to repair a corrupted cache. The cache is automatically invalidated if the deployed corpus's `embedding_model` or `embedding_dimensions` no longer match the current request, with a warning.
- `npm run librarian:graph` builds `data/librarian/graph.json`, the offline entity/trope/similarity artifact used by the archive tools.
- `pipeline/deploy/bedrock_logging.py` inspects or enables account-level Bedrock invocation logging to the private Librarian bucket.

The previous Python eval pipeline under `pipeline/eval/` was removed. Conversation quality review now happens through the event-driven Eval Lambda described below.

## AWS Runtime

The backend is defined in `apps/librarian/infra/cloudformation.yaml`. Auth and auth health checks run behind API Gateway/Lambda. Streaming chat and stream health checks run through a Lambda Function URL with response streaming enabled. It uses:

- Buttondown API for subscriber lookup.
- Amazon Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4.6 for premium messages and the agent loop.
- Amazon Bedrock Cohere Embed v3 for query-to-archive retrieval.
- Amazon Bedrock Cohere Rerank 3.5 after archive searches.
- DynamoDB for magic-link tokens, sessions, rate limits, canonical conversations, turns, artifacts, feedback, eval metadata, and per-user memory.
- S3 for embedded Weekly Thing, blog, and podcast corpora plus the offline graph artifact.
- CloudWatch Logs for structured JSON request, retrieval, upstream, and error logs.

Chat streams from `site.librarianStreamUrl + /chat`; there is no buffered API Gateway chat fallback. Welcome messages are generated agentically by `/welcome`, using authenticated profile, local-time context, previous conversations, and active entitlements. Conversations are server-side and canonical; the browser no longer sends the full history as the source of truth.

The FAQ content lives in `apps/librarian/lambda/shared/faq.json`. Eleventy renders `/faq/` from that file, and the streaming Lambda packages the same file so Thingy can answer site, subscription, membership, RSS, privacy, and logistics questions through the `search_faq` tool.

## Commands

```sh
npm run librarian:corpus
npm run librarian:graph
npm run librarian:bedrock:logging
npm run librarian:corpus:upload
npm run librarian:deploy
```

After deployment, the deploy script writes the CloudFormation `LibrarianApiUrl` and `LibrarianStreamUrl` outputs to `.env` as `LIBRARIAN_API_URL` and `LIBRARIAN_STREAM_URL`. The static site reads those values during build, with the current production URLs kept only as a fallback in `apps/site/_data/site.js`.

## Required Secrets

Deploy and corpus upload scripts load AWS credentials from `.env` through `python-dotenv` before creating `boto3` clients. They do not intentionally fall back to AWS CLI profile authentication.

## Permanent IAM Setup

Deploys use the AWS credentials loaded from `.env`. Routine deploys currently use the `wt-archive` IAM user with an attached `WeeklyThingLibrarianDeploy` managed policy. That policy grants enough access to create or harden the private `weekly-thing-librarian` bucket, upload `s3://weekly-thing-librarian/code/*` and `s3://weekly-thing-librarian/artifacts/*`, and update the `weekly-thing-librarian` CloudFormation stack.

`files.thingelstad.com` is the public website asset bucket. Thingy code packages, corpus files, and Bedrock invocation logs belong in the private `LIBRARIAN_BUCKET`.

The long-term cleanup is still a dedicated CloudFormation service role.

The stack already creates a Lambda execution role for Thingy. The remaining production cleanup is a dedicated deployment path:

- Create a `weekly-thing-librarian-cloudformation` service role trusted by CloudFormation.
- Give that service role permissions only for the Librarian stack resources: Lambda, API Gateway HTTP API, DynamoDB table, the Lambda execution role, CloudWatch log groups, CloudWatch alarms/dashboard, and `s3://$LIBRARIAN_BUCKET/*`.
- Create a narrow deploy identity, preferably a GitHub Actions OIDC role if deployments move into Actions, that can upload private Librarian S3 artifacts and update only the `weekly-thing-librarian` CloudFormation stack.
- Set `LIBRARIAN_CLOUDFORMATION_ROLE_ARN` to the service role ARN before running `npm run librarian:deploy`.

The deploy script passes `LIBRARIAN_CLOUDFORMATION_ROLE_ARN` to CloudFormation when present, so the caller only needs permission to upload artifacts, update the stack, and pass that one service role.

## Access Model

Thingy uses mandatory email magic-link authentication. A visitor enters an email address, Lambda checks Buttondown for an active subscriber, stores a one-time token hash in DynamoDB, and sends a sign-in link from `thingy@thingelstad.com` through Fastmail JMAP. Redeeming that link proves inbox possession and returns an HMAC-signed session token. Tokens expire after ten days, and a still-valid token can be refreshed by `/auth` `action=refresh_session` so weekly use keeps a reader signed in. Once the token expires, the only public email auth path is a new magic link.

Premium subscribers get a small Bedrock-generated Supporting Member thank-you before entering chat, with a fixed fallback if Bedrock is unavailable. Unknown email addresses can opt in from the sign-in page; those signups are created in Buttondown and must confirm before using Thingy. The logout control clears the browser's stored session token and returns to the sign-in page.

### Conversation modes

Mode availability is encoded in the signed session token as entitlements and enforced on both conversation creation and chat.

| Mode | Entitlement | Grant source |
|---|---|---|
| `thingy` | `reader` | Any active subscriber |
| `research_guide` | `supporting_member` | Premium subscriber or `thingy-supporting-member` tag |
| `thought_partner` | `owner` | Jamie's owner email/hash or `thingy-owner` tag |
| `trusted_circle` | `trusted_circle` | `thingy-trusted-circle`, `thingy-family`, or `thingy-close-friends` tag |

Modes change Thingy's posture, not corpus access. Thought Partner is more candid and challenging for Jamie; Research Guide leans into timelines and reading paths; Trusted Circle is warmer and closer; default Thingy is concise, useful, and reader-facing.

### Discord bridge auth

The workshop-bot Discord bridge (`apps/workshop_bot/personas/thingy.py`) gets a fourth `/auth` action: `discord_bridge`. The bridge POSTs `{action: "discord_bridge", bridge_secret, discord_user_id, source: "discord"}` and receives a normal session token whose `sub` is `discord:<sha256(user_id)[:32]>` instead of an email hash. Per-Discord-user rate limits work transparently because the chat handler treats `payload.sub` as an opaque key.

The bridge action is gated by `DISCORD_BRIDGE_SECRET` (CloudFormation parameter `DiscordBridgeSecret`). When that env var is empty the action returns 503 ("Discord bridge is not enabled"), so the bridge is off by default until the secret is configured. Token mints are rate-limited per Discord user (default 60/hour, override via `DISCORD_BRIDGE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`).

Operator conversation reads are email-less and gated by the **same** `DISCORD_BRIDGE_SECRET` (operator secret, not a per-user session token). `list_conversations` returns conversation summaries from canonical server-side rows; `get_conversation` returns the full transcript/turns for a conversation. The Discord bot uses those endpoints for follow-up actions, while the Eval Lambda posts review summaries directly to Discord through `DISCORD_CONVERSATION_WEBHOOK_URL`. Discord is notification/review tooling only and is not in the reader request path.

### Per-user memory

Auth returns a `profile` field populated from a per-user memory row in the existing DynamoDB table (key `user#{sub}` / `memory`). The chat handler updates this row at the end of each turn and Bedrock-summarizes previous conversations, rolling them into a compact per-user history. The agent can also store explicit reader-provided facts through `remember_user`, such as preferred name, archive interests, or answer-style preferences.

The `profile` shape is:

```json
{
  "returning": true,
  "first_seen_at": "...",
  "last_seen_at": "...",
  "turn_count": 7,
  "entitlements": ["reader", "supporting_member"],
  "modes": [{"id": "thingy", "label": "Thingy"}],
  "current_session_questions": [{"ts": "...", "question": "..."}],
  "prior_session_summaries": [{"summary": "...", "started_at": "...", "ended_at": "...", "turn_count": 3}]
}
```

The chat handler also injects a compact memory-context block as a second (uncached) system message, so Thingy can naturally reference what a returning reader has been exploring in past sessions. The static system prompt stays cached.

Memory rows carry a one-year TTL (`LIBRARIAN_USER_MEMORY_TTL_DAYS`, default 365); the row is rewritten on every turn so active users effectively never expire.

## Link Parameters

`/thingy/` accepts optional query parameters for subscriber-friendly deep links:

- `email`: pre-fills the subscriber email field. The visitor still has to submit the gate, and the backend still validates the address against Buttondown.
- `prompt`: queues a first question. Once the visitor has a valid session, Thingy submits that question automatically and suppresses the generated welcome so the prompt is the first conversation event.

Both parameters are independent. `/thingy/?prompt=What%20has%20Jamie%20written%20about%20RSS%3F` lets the visitor enter their own email, then auto-starts the prompt after validation. `/thingy/?email=reader%40example.com` only pre-fills the email. `/thingy/?email=reader%40example.com&prompt=What%20has%20Jamie%20written%20about%20RSS%3F` does both.

## Logging And Review

Lambda writes structured JSON logs to CloudWatch. Logs include request ID, route, status code, duration, subscriber email hash, retrieval mode, citation count, upstream status/duration, and error type. Raw email addresses, API keys, and session tokens are not logged. The backend does not call Tinylytics; server-side activity should come from CloudWatch logs, metrics, and DynamoDB conversation review.

Every API response includes an `x-request-id` header. Browser-visible errors include that reference so the matching CloudWatch request can be found quickly.

Successful conversations are stored as canonical server-side rows in DynamoDB:

- `conversation#<id>` metadata rows with title, preview, source scope, mode, timestamps, eval fields, and latest request ID
- `turn#<conversation>#<timestamp>#<request>` rows with prompt, answer, citations, source scope, tool trace, feedback reaction/comment, runtime metadata, and artifacts
- `memory` rows with per-user continuity data

The Eval Lambda is triggered by DynamoDB Streams. It reviews updated conversations out of band, writes `eval_*` fields back to the conversation row, updates generated titles when appropriate, and posts compact cards to Discord through a webhook. The local operator report (`apps/librarian/admin/operator_report.py`) reads these same canonical rows and generates a static HTML report on Jamie's Desktop.

The reader UI lets users upvote/downvote responses and optionally explain downvotes. Feedback is stored on the matching turn and appears in operator review.

`GET /health` is available as a cheap smoke-test endpoint. It verifies API Gateway and Lambda routing without calling Buttondown, Bedrock, DynamoDB, or S3.

`POST /feedback` is served by the streaming Lambda Function URL and requires a valid session token. It accepts `request_id`, `reaction` (`up` or `down`), and optional `comment`, then updates the matching turn when it belongs to the same subscriber hash.

Thingy uses hybrid retrieval. It merges semantic embedding matches, lexical matches, and issue-summary/topic graph matches, reranks the top candidates with Cohere Rerank 3.5 through the Bedrock Agent Runtime rerank API, then applies context-aware recency and issue diversity. Current/recommendation questions prefer newer material when relevance is close. History/evolution questions intentionally preserve sources across eras.

Chat requests run through a tool-using Claude Sonnet 4.6 loop capped by `MAX_TOOL_TURNS` (default 8). The agent can call:

- `search_faq(query, limit?)`
- `search_archive(query, year_range?, section?, limit?)`
- `get_source(source_kind?, url?, issue_number?)`
- `get_issue(number)`
- `get_section(number, section)`
- `find_links(domain?, topic?, source_kind?, link_kind?, link_category?, target_resolved?, year_range?)`
- `domain_history(domain)`
- `corpus_stats(...)`
- `latest_content(...)`
- `quote_search(phrase)`
- `list_content(...)`
- `list_issues(year?, topic?, entity?)`
- `compare_eras(topic, year_a, year_b)`
- `archive_lens(topic, operation?, source_kind?, year_range?)`
- `entity_lens(entity, operation?, source_kind?)`
- `source_neighborhood(source_kind?, url?, issue_number?)`
- `archive_gems(theme?, mood?, source_kind?)`
- `claim_check(claim)`
- `remember_user(...)`

Thingy uses magic-link auth, rate limits, server-side history, and DynamoDB logging. Tool status is emitted over the streaming Function URL as `status` events, and the UI keeps the archive work visible/collapsible after completion.

The graph artifact is built offline from the corpus and archive front matter. It stores per-issue entities, recurring tropes/stances, and top-K similar issues from issue-level embedding averages. `pipeline/graph/build.py --use-bedrock-extraction` can use Sonnet for entity/trope extraction; the default heuristic mode is available for cheap local refreshes.

Typical cost is controlled by prompt caching on the stable system prompt and tool definitions, reranking only the top search candidates, limiting tool turns, and clipping tool result text. The target remains under $0.20 for typical questions and under $0.50 for worst-case multi-hop questions.

Thingy answers cite Weekly Thing issue numbers inline when using newsletter sources, and cite blog/podcast sources by title/permalink because they do not have issue numbers. The API returns citation metadata and the web client renders rich markdown, tables, horizontal rules, citations, copy/share/play actions, and tool-work traces.

Follow-up questions use server-side conversation history. The browser sends the active `conversation_id`; the stream Lambda loads the relevant turns, compacts them when needed, and injects recent context into the model.

## Tinylytics Events

The site loads Tinylytics with `events` and `beacon` enabled. Thingy emits these events:

- `librarian.auth_submit`
- `librarian.auth_success`
- `librarian.auth_error` with value `client` or `server`
- `librarian.auth_not_found`
- `librarian.auth_unconfirmed`
- `librarian.auth_subscribe_success`
- `librarian.auth_reminder_success`
- `librarian.auth_inactive`
- `librarian.logout`
- `librarian.session_resume`
- `librarian.question_submit`
- `librarian.answer_success` with value `{question-size}.{citation-count}`
- `librarian.answer_error` with value `client` or `server`
- `librarian.feedback_submit` with value `up` or `down`
- `librarian.feedback_error` with value `client` or `server`
- `librarian.source_click` with the cited issue number
- mode, source picker, curiosity map, voice input, and conversation events may also be emitted by the web client; keep this list aligned with the Thingy web repo when changing the UI.

Tinylytics is only used by the website/browser. The Librarian API does not emit server-side Tinylytics events.

## Deployment Checklist

For a normal code-only Thingy deployment:

```sh
python pipeline/deploy/aws.py --skip-corpus-upload
```

For a full corpus refresh and deploy:

```sh
python pipeline/deploy/aws.py
```

`python pipeline/deploy/aws.py` packages both Lambdas, uploads their zip files, builds/uploads all three embedded corpus artifacts, builds/uploads the Weekly Thing graph artifact, and updates the CloudFormation stack. Use `make librarian-corpora-upload` by itself only when the deployed code is unchanged and only API corpus artifacts need to be refreshed.

New external publishing content has its own ingest step before corpus upload:

- Blog posts: `.github/workflows/sync-external-content.yml` runs `pipeline/blog/ingest_blog.py --since-last` against Micro.blog and commits changes to `data/blog/**`.
- Podcast episodes: the same workflow checks out `another.thingelstad.com`, runs `pipeline/podcast/import_another_thing.py`, and commits changes to `data/podcast/**`.

Those commits trigger the production workflow, which rebuilds and uploads the updated corpus artifacts. A newly published blog post will not reach Thingy unless this sync workflow runs successfully with `MICROBLOG_API_KEY` configured.

The deploy script packages both Lambda entrypoints from one Node source tree:

- `apps/librarian/lambda/auth/`: API Gateway Lambda for Buttondown auth and auth health checks.
- `apps/librarian/lambda/chat/`: Lambda Function URL for streaming chat and stream health checks.
- `apps/librarian/lambda/eval/`: DynamoDB Stream evaluator packaged with the auth bundle.
- `apps/librarian/lambda/shared/` and `apps/librarian/lambda/prompts/`: shared code and editable prompt files included in both packages.

After deploy:

```sh
curl -sS -i https://k0yklt9vg3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/health
curl -sS -i -X OPTIONS https://jcvud66qqpq53frvno5stoqntm0zqntw.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
```

The static site still needs its normal deploy after frontend or content changes.
